# üöÄ NUCLEAR OPTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## üî• What Was Fixed
**Applied the NUCLEAR OPTION for parts links and YouTube videos!**

The AI now has **EXPLICIT EXAMPLES** that force it to include:
- ‚úÖ **Real part numbers** (WE11X10018, WH13X10037, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Specific cost ranges** ($150-$245, $125-$215, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Exact parts links** (Amazon: "WE11X10018", eBay: "washer water inlet valve", etc.)
- ‚úÖ **YouTube video suggestions** ("How to Replace Dryer Heating Element", etc.)

## üìÇ Deploy Options

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. **Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)**
2. **Find your site**
3. **Drag entire APplinace411 folder** to deploy area
4. **Wait ~2 minutes for deployment**

### Option 2: GitHub Upload (If Available)
1. **Upload all files to your GitHub repository**
2. **Netlify will auto-deploy**

## üß™ Test It
1. **Upload an appliance photo**
2. **Look for these new sections:**
   - **"‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PROBLEMS & REPAIR COSTS"** with real cost ranges
   - **"üîß COMMONLY REPLACED PARTS, COSTS & RESOURCES"** with:
     - Real part numbers (WE11X10018, etc.)
     - Where to buy links (Amazon: "search term", etc.)
     - YouTube video suggestions
